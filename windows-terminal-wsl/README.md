Lots of people ask which terminal I use on Windows and how I configure it.  It's pretty simple, I use the Microsoft Windows Terminal and it's a fantastic terminal on Windows.  It is free and open source.  With Windows Terminal, you can install and configure different environments for Windows and Linux.  You can choose between Ubuntu or any other WSL 1 or WSL 2  (Windows Subsystem for Linux) environment along with the typical PowerShell and cmd.  In this fast, simple, and easy tutorial we'll set up the Windows Terminal, install WSL, then install Ubuntu, and configure Ubuntu with ZSH (zshell) and oh my zsh (0h-my-zsh).  Then, you'll know exactly how I configure my Terminal on Windows.  *Bonus* Now all your copy pasta commands will work on Windows, macOS, and Linux!
