What is a Home Lab and how do you get started?  It's easy.  You can get started today in a few different ways.  You can virtualize your entire home lab or build it on an old PC, a Raspberry Pi, or even some enterprise servers.  The choice is really up to you. You'll need to first establish some goals for your homelab to determine capacity for your workloads. After that, the rest is up to you.  You can take it as far as you want to go, and remember each home lab is almost as unique as the individual who builds it!
